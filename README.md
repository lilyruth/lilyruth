# 🎉 Hi Friends! 

## 🌷 I'm Ruthie. Nice to meet you!

 💖 I'm a career changer who went from education and librarianship to software engineering.  
 🖥️ I work mostly in the data engineering world now, and as I am still ramping up I don't have a lot of time for personal projects.  
 📈 However I'm continuing my learning with several resources... and am hoping to make a sizeable dent in Advent of Code 2023!
