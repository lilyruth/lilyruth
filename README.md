# 🎉 Hi Friends! 

## 🌷 I'm Ruthie. Nice to meet you!

###  I'm working in JavaScript, React and Java. 

 🤩 I'm currently enrolled in the [Cook Systems FastTrack](https://www.allaboutfasttrack.com) bootcamp.  
 💖 I graduated the [Nucamp](https://nucamp.co) Full Stack and Mobile development bootcamp in November 2021.  
 🖥️ I earned some [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org/ruthiec) certifications between 2020 and 2022.  
 📈 I'm continuing my learning with [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/lilyruthc) & Udemy.   
 🎓 My first career was in education. I earned a BA in Interdisciplinary Studies and a Master of Library Science and spent over a decade teaching, and learning through that teaching.  
 ✨ I'm hoping to get involved in open source projects this year.
