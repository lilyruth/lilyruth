# 🎉 Hi Friends! 

## 🌷 I'm Ruthie. Nice to meet you!

### 🎓 I've earned a BA, MLS & multiple teaching certifications, and I'm making the change to tech. 
- 🖥️ I'm learning with [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org/ruthiec), [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/devRuthie) & Udemy. 
- 💜 As BTSARMY, I'm combining my library skills and web dev learning into a large project: [Index 0613](https://index0613.com). It's a work in progress and currently on version 2. 
- ✨ I'm hoping to get involved in open source projects this year. 

### 🐦 You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/devRuthie)!
